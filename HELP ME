Please man, That's the only money that I have, I have a sick mom, grandmother and sister to sustain, It's the only money I have in my life, you are dooming all of us, I know you have a family, I have medicine to buy
I'm begging to you, just send back some funds, I can let my family die, I'm unemployed and I'm from a poor country. Please, I'm crying and desperate
